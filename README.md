# Frontend Commerce

Welcome! This is a modern e-commerce storefront built with **Next.js 15** and **TypeScript**. We've designed it to be fast, accessible, and look great on any device. It's fully set up as a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it feels just like a native app on mobile.

## Tech Stack

We're using a solid stack of modern tools to ensure a great developer experience and a performant app:

- **Next.js 15** (App Router) for the framework.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and flexible styling.
- **Shadcn/UI** because who doesn't love beautiful, accessible components?
- **Zustand** for simple, unopinionated state management.
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** to handle forms without the headache.
- **Next-PWA** to give it that offline-capable, installable superpower.

## What's Inside?

- **App-like Experience**: Takes advantage of PWA capabilities, so you can install it on your phone and browse offline.
- **Responsive & fluid**: Looks and works perfectly whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop.
- **Smooth Shopping**: A complete flow from browsing products to adding them to your cart and checking out.
- **User Friendly**: Includes a dedicated bottom navigation bar for mobile users, making it super easy to get around.
- **Ready to Go**: Comes with pre-built pages for Products, details, Checkout, Profile, and more.
